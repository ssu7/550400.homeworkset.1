%\noindent\textbf{General Instruction:} 
%To complete the homework set, you are required to do the followings. 
%Your solutions must be typed in \LaTeX\ using the course homework
%template.  
%The progression of your homework solution is to be
%``recorded'' by making a git folder specifically for this homework
%set.  The burden of proof is on you, and if your git commit history
%is sparse, then you may be liable for a penalty.  
%A paper copy of the PDF output of your \LaTeX\ file is 
%to be submitted to your instructor in class on the due date.
%\emph{After} submitting the paper copy, but \emph{before} the end of
%the due date, you will upload your work to your github by making a remote repository
%specifically for the homework, and post the link to the repository 
%at the designated \emph{Discussion} forum in Blackboard by making 
%a thread just for you.  The repository name in your github should be
%\texttt{550400.homeworkset.1} and the discussion forum thread should
%be named \texttt{YourFirstNameMiddleInitialLastName}, e.g.,
%\texttt{BaracHObama} and \texttt{WillardMRommey}. 
%You have till the end of 
%the due date to finalize your github repository.  
%However, any commit made after the class time of the due date will be 
%inadmissible. \emph{Your attention to details in following this instruction will be 
%critical, and if not followed exactly at the time of collection, the
%homework set may be graded at $90\%$ of the full score}.

\noindent\textbf{Problem 1 (10 pts):}
%Assume that you are starting from ``scratch'' at the directory \verb+~/+.
%Provide a sequence of git/bash commands that yields a git folder with 
%a commit history such that:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item the \emph{master} branch has commits $A$, $B$, $C$, $X$ and $D$,
%\item the \emph{alt} branch has commits $A$, $B$, $X$,
%\end{itemize}
%Suppose that you are currently working on \texttt{master} branch. Draw 
%its commit history graph (i.e., the graph portion of the output of
%\verb+git log --graph --oneline+).  Next, assume that 
%you are on \texttt{alt} branch. Draw its commit history graph.\newline

\noindent To produce the two branches each with the desired commit history the following GIT Bash commands can be executed:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ mkdir hondacivic.git
$ cd hondacivic.git
$ git init
$ vi main.txt #Create main.txt and add Line A
$ git add main.txt
$ git commit -m "A is Done"
$ vi main.txt #Add Line B to main.txt
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "B is Done"
$ git branch alt #Create branch named alt that has A and B commits
$ vi main.txt #Add Line C to main.txt
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "C is Done"
$ git checkout alt #Switch to alt branch
$ vi main.txt #Add Line X to main.txt in the alt branch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "X is Done"
$ git checkout master #Switch the master branch
$ git merge alt #Merge the master branch with the alt branch
$ vi main.txt #Resolve the merge conflict
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "D is Done"
\end{lstlisting}  

\noindent The following figure represents the commit history graph when on the \texttt{master} branch:

\noindent\textbf{Problem 2 (10 pts):}

\noindent Assume that you have created a new github repository at: 
\begin{center} 
\texttt{https://github.com/ssu7/PoemCollection.git}
\end{center} 
\newline The following GIT Bash commands will produce what the problem asks for:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ git config --global user.name "Steven" #Sets the user name
$ git config --global user.email "stevenemail@yahoo.com" #Sets the email of the user
$ mkdir hondacrv.git #Makes new git folder
$ cd hondacrv.git #Changes the directory to the git folder
$ git init #Initializes the git folder
$ git remote add Stanza1 git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza1.git #Creates alias for stanza 1
$ git remote add Stanza2 git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza2.git #Creates alias for stanza 2
$ git remote add Stanza3 git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza3.git #Creates alias for stanza 3
$ git pull Stanza1 master
$ vi main.txt #Add Title to Poem in VIM
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Stanza1 Added"
$ git pull Stanza2 master
$ vi main.txt # Resolve Merge Conflict in VIM
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Stanza2 Added"
$ git pull Stanza3 master
$ vi main.txt # Resolve Merge Conflict in VIM
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Stanza3 Added"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/ssu7/PoemCollection.git
$ git push origin master #Pushes main.txt to the previously setup github repository
\end{lstlisting}


%Assume that you are starting from ``scratch'' at the directory \verb+~/+.
%Provide a sequence of git/bash commands that yields a git folder and 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item configure your git with your name and your email address,
%\item set up an alias for each of the git remotes listed below:
%\begin{verbatim}
%git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza1.git 
%git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza2.git 
%git://github.com/nhlee/550400.stanza3.git 
%\end{verbatim}
%Assume that each remote contains exactly single commit with 
%a txt file for a single (different) stanza,
%\item pull to combine three stanzas of a poem,
%\item after the first pull, add the title of the poem,
%\item after the second and third pull, resolve the merge conflict,
%\item after resolving the third pull merge conflict, push the result
%  to your (newly created) remote repository. 
%\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Problem 3 (40 pts):}

\noindent The main issue faced by these 4 students is an organizational problem. How can the 4 students work on their portions of the project without using 

There are two main approches this group of students can take towards solving their problem.
%Consider a team of four students, say, $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$, 
%who just started working 
%on writing a \texttt{latex/beamer} file, say \texttt{main.tex}, 
%for a class presentation of their work statement.  
%Assume that they do not wish to coordinate their schedules for a
%concurrent group meeting (both virtually and physically).  
%Assume that:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $A$ is in charge of \emph{Introduction},
%\item $B$ is of \emph{Problem Statement}, 
%\item $C$ is of  \emph{Timeline},
%\item $D$ is of \emph{Deliverable} part of the presentation.  
%\end{itemize}
%In other words, their contributions to \texttt{main.tex} do not overlap.
%Then, 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item first, devise a work flow strategy for the team so that they can
%  collaborate asynchronously using \texttt{git},
%\item next, devise yet another \texttt{git} strategy different from your earlier
%  proposal.  
%\end{itemize}
%Finally,
%\begin{itemize}
%\item discuss the strength and weakness of each of your proposed strategies in terms of merge
%conflicts resolution,
%\item make the final recommendation.  
%\end{itemize}
%In order to answer this question, \emph{build}
%a mathematical model, \emph{following} the guideline from IMM. 
%Use Section 1.4 and Section 1.5 of IMM as \emph{role models}.    
%For example, you are to identify which variables  are exogenous 
%and which are endogenous.  More specifically, among other things, 
%in your model, is the preamble part of \texttt{main.tex} an endogenous 
%or exogenous variable?  
%Note also that in addition to this issue, there are other issues that
%you are to consider.  So, \emph{be sure to consult IMM}. 
\vskip0.25in
\noindent\textbf{Problem 4 (aka.\ Fair Play, 40 pts):}
Answer the following question:
\begin{verse}
Is the tennis game fair?
\end{verse}
Note that unlike Problem 3, this question is vaguely stated.
This is intensional, whence to begin, you will first need to clarify
what exactly your question is.
You may use the class discussion on this particular 
problem, but you \emph{may not} directly refer to our 
discussion.  Instead, formulate the model carefully but concisely in 
your own words.   

\vskip0.25in
\noindent\textbf{Final Remarks about Problem 3 \& Problem 4:} 
They are open-ended problems.  However, your scores will be determined
by how well do you follow the exposition style outlined by IMM and
WMA.  For both problems, your write-up should be 
\begin{itemize}
\item self-contained,
\item covering all four parts of Section 1.3 of IMM,
\item paying a particular attention to any causal relation that you
  might be investigating, following Chapter 3 of WMA,
\item answering questions that are explicitly asked in the problem statements.
\end{itemize}
For Problem 3, focus mostly on Step 2 and Step 3 of Section
1.3 of IMM.  For Problem 4, focus mostly on Step 1 and Step
2.  For each problem, minimum 1 pages and maximum 2 pages.
